                    Adventure Time is set in the fictional "Land of Ooo", in a post-apocalyptic future about a thousand years after a nuclear holocaust called the "Great Mushroom War".
                    According to Ward, the show takes place "after the bombs have fallen and magic has come back into the world".
                    Before the series was fully developed, Ward intended the Land of Ooo to simply be "magical". 
                    After the production of the episode "Business Time", in which an iceberg containing reanimated businessmen floats to the surface of a lake, 
                    the show became explicitly post-apocalyptic; Ward said the production crew "just ran with it".
                    Ward later described the setting as "candyland on the surface and dark underneath",
                    noting he had never intended the Mushroom War and the post-apocalyptic elements to be "hit over the head in the show".
                    He limited it to "cars buried underground in the background [and other elements that do not] raise any eyebrows".
                    Ward has said the series' post-apocalyptic elements were influenced by the 1979 film Mad Max. 
                    Kenny called the way the elements are worked into the plot "very fill-in-the-blanks", and DiMaggio said, "it's been obvious the Land of Ooo has some issues". <br><br>
                    The series has a canonical mythology—or, an overarching plot and backstory—that is expanded upon in various episodes. 
                    This mythology mainly involves the nature of the Mushroom War, the origin of the series' principal antagonist the Lich, 
                    and the backstories of several of the series' principal and recurring characters.
                    Ward once noted that the details behind the Mushroom War and the series' dark mythology form "a story worth telling", 
                    but he also felt the show would be better off if the show "dance[d] around how heavy the back-history of Ooo is"<br><br>
